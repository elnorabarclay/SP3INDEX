   <h2>Do your Research</h2>
   <p> Social media changes fast, so you can't limit your research to your owned accounts.
      Social listening is a good way to get a sense of what's happening in your industry
      and what people are talking about when they talk about your business on social media.</p> 

   <h2>Sets Goals</h2>
   <p>It's a good idea to get specific with your goals using the SMART goal-setting framework.
      This forces you to think in detail about what you can achieve with your social content, 
      and how you might get to where you want to be.</p>
   
   <h2>Have a Creative Brainstorm</h2>
   <p>This is “no bad ideas” time. Everyone on your team has unique experiences with social,
       both personally and professionally, that will inform their content ideas and expectations.
      Allowing everyone to share freely brings all of that knowledge into your shared braintrust,
       where it can morph into high-quality social content campaigns.</p>
   
   <h2>Assign Roals </h2>
   <p> This is a good time to think about whether you want to outsource some digital content creation
       tasks to freelance writers or designers. You should also think about how to source and incorporate
       user-generated content, and how to include curated content in your social media marketing strategy.</p>
    
   <h2>Build a Content Calendar</h2>
   <p>We've created a content calendar template to help you plan how to use content resources
       across your social accounts. For example, say you want to drive social traffic to a new blog post. 
       You can use your content calendar to plan out when to post the relevant
       Facebook post, TikTok, and Instagram Reel.</p>
   
   <h2>Schedule your Contents</h2>
   <p>Once you've filled in your content calendar, it's time to set your content up for publishing.
       Sure, you could post each post manually at the assigned time, but that's a huge time-waster
       that also sets you up to make simple mistakes like typos and broken links.</p>
   
   <h2>Audit your Content</h2>
   <p>Any successful social post can be made into a template for future posts.
       You can also add approved images to your content library, whether those are created
       in-house or acquired from a royalty-free resource.</p> 
   
   <h2>Track your Progress</h2>
   <p>The content creation process ends back where it started. Analyze your results to see what worked and what didn't, 
      and use your findings to guide your research and planning into what to do next.
       Set some new goals and do it all again</p>
